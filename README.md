This project is a web-based deep learning application designed to classify retinal fundus images into different stages of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using a fine-tuned ResNet-152 model. It integrates a React frontend with a Flask backend powered by PyTorch, providing users with an interactive and efficient way to screen for DR. The frontend allows users to upload retinal images, while the backend handles preprocessing and inference, delivering accurate predictions in real time.

The model predicts five DR stages: Mild, Moderate, No_DR, Proliferate_DR, and Severe. Upon uploading an image, the backend preprocesses it and passes it through the ResNet-152 model to generate the predicted class along with confidence scores for each category. The system was trained and validated on a dataset of 7,718 images, with 5,418 images for training, 1,541 for validation, and 759 for testing, ensuring robust performance across different DR stages.

The application supports GPU acceleration for faster inference and is structured for easy deployment on cloud platforms such as AWS or Render. Future enhancements may include Grad-CAM visualization for better model explainability, batch image processing, and integration with hospital data systems for real-world clinical applications. This tool provides an accessible and reliable solution for early detection and classification of Diabetic Retinopathy.
